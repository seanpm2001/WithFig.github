# Contributing to Fig

Thanks for taking the time to build out the future of the terminal with us! ðŸ¥³

We want to make contributing to Fig as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Submitting feature requests

- Contributing content or feature changes
  

## Our Repos

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Here are some of our primary repos.

[withfig/fig](https://github.com/withfig/fig): The central repo. All issues taken here.

[withfig/autocomplete](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete): Collection of all specs for [autocomplete](https://docs.withfig.com/autocomplete). Contribute new specs and update old specs here.

[withfig/config](https://github.com/withfig/config): Fig's default configuration at install. Contains apps, installation, and update scripts.


## Proposing changes

Fig welcomes code contributions via pull request. Here are a few styling guides to keep in mind:

**Git Commit Messages**

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line


## Bug reports and feature requests

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs as well as new feature requests. If you have any input, [open a new issue](https://github.com/withfig/fig)! Note that all issues should be filed under the [withfig/fig](https://github.com/withfig/fig) repo, not under independent feature repos.
